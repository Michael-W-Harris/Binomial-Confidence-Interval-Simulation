# Binomial-Confidence-Interval-Simulation
This code is a small simulation showing the correct 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the binomial random variable.
This outputs a table (as seen in example plot 1) that shows the width of the CIs for different parameterizations of number of trials and sample size.
The second table (example plot 2) evaluates the simulated accuracy of these confidence intervals, over the same range using many iterations of random data generation.
